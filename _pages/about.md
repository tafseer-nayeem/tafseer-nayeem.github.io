👋Hi, there!

<p align="justify">
I’m Mir <b>Tafseer</b> Nayeem, a second-year <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html">Computing Science</a> Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html">University of Alberta</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~drafiei/">Davood Rafiei</a>. My research interests include, but are not limited to, Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Computational Social Science. My Ph.D. research is about human-centric modeling of content (<i>with different modalities such as text, table, ratings, etc.</i>), especially two key factors (1) <b>who</b> are behind the content and (2) to <b>whom</b> the model will serve (<i>see graphical illustration below</i>).</p>

<p align="justify">
My research is generously supported by a <span style="color:Red">Huawei Doctoral Scholarship</span>. My work was previously nominated for <span style="color:Red">Best Paper Award</span> and selected as <span style="color:Red">Area Chair Favorite Paper</span> at <a href="http://coling2018.org/coling-2018-best-papers/">COLING 2018</a>.
</p>
